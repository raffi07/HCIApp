# Prototype HCI

## Description

This is our prototype for the HCI Course in Fall Semester 2019. 

Our topic was the Teacher <> Children <> Parent communication at school. After doing some empirical research through interviews with teachers, we identified that the biggest concern about communicating with parents through the kids is the uncertainty, where the given information currently is. Still the fact that the children should be responsible for their own concerns shouldn't be left out, which is why we decided to help the teachers and the parents through informing them about the letter and provide a rough description (with the letter title which is shown in the notification) of the letter's content. However our testing persons agreed, that sending the letter directly to the parents via the app would result in eliminating the kid's task, which is not the goal.
Both parties are able to track the current status about the sent information and to take action if needed (e.g. ask the child if they already fulfilled their duty). 

The Photo Wall is just a fun gimmick for the teacher to show the class in a daily routine in order to encourage those, who haven't yet delivered the letter.

Information letters are letters that go one way: From teacher to parent without any further response (except the picture).
Response letters are letters that have to be returned, because the teacher needs a response from the parents.

## Launch information

This application was designed with the Android SDK **9.0 Pie API 28** in Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA.

## Disclaimer

As this is a prototype some functionalities are scripted and therefore not reproducible with every single item. However the logic is in most cases there and could be implemented with a little bit of tweaking. Also file uploads / QR Scanner and Camera is not working as expected, this should just be used for demonstration purposes.
